This guide walks you through creating a complete Android app using only natural language prompts.

## End-to-End Workflow

<Steps>
1. **Create a project**

   > Create a new Android project called HelloWorld with package name com.example.helloworld

   This creates a Jetpack Compose project with all the standard Gradle configuration.

2. **Build the project**

   > Build my HelloWorld Android project

   This runs a debug build and produces an APK.

3. **Start an emulator**

   > Start the Pixel_6_API_35 emulator

   Or create one first if you don't have any:

   > Create an Android 35 emulator called TestDevice and start it

4. **Install the APK**

   > Install the HelloWorld debug APK on the emulator

5. **Launch the app**

   > Launch com.example.helloworld

6. **Take a screenshot**

   > Take a screenshot of the device

   Verify your app is running correctly.
</Steps>

  You don't need to remember exact commands or paths. Just describe what you want in natural language and the AI editor will figure out which tools to use.
