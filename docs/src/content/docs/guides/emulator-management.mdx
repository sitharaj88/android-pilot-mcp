## Creating Emulators

### Standard Emulator

> Create an Android 35 emulator called Pixel6_API35

### Custom Device Profile

> Create an emulator called Pixel7Pro_API34 with a Pixel 7 Pro device profile and API 34

### Available System Images

First, check what's available:

> List available SDK packages

Then install a system image if needed:

> Install system-images;android-35;google_apis;arm64-v8a

## Starting and Stopping

### Basic Start

> Start the Pixel6_API35 emulator

### Cold Boot

> Start the emulator with a cold boot

Cold boot ignores any saved snapshot and boots from scratch. Useful when the emulator is in a bad state.

### Headless Mode

> Start the emulator in headless mode (no window)

Perfect for CI/CD environments.

### Wiping Data

> Start the emulator and wipe all data

Resets the emulator to factory state.

### Stopping

> Stop the running emulator

## WiFi ADB

Connect to a physical device wirelessly:

<Steps>
1. Connect your device via USB first
2. > Connect to my device over WiFi ADB
3. Unplug the USB cable
4. Your device stays connected over WiFi
</Steps>

To disconnect:

> Disconnect WiFi ADB

<Aside type="caution">
  WiFi ADB requires the device and computer to be on the same network. The device must be initially connected via USB.
</Aside>

## CI/CD Setup

For headless testing in CI pipelines:

> Create an emulator called CI_Test with API 35 and start it headless with cold boot and wiped data

This creates a clean, reproducible test environment.
