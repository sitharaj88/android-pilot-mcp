## Project Creation

### Jetpack Compose Project (default)

> Create a new Android project called MyApp with package com.example.myapp in ~/Projects

Creates a complete project with Kotlin, Gradle KTS, and Jetpack Compose.

### XML Layout Project

> Create an XML-based Android project called MyApp with package com.example.myapp

### Custom SDK Versions

> Create a project called LegacyApp with minSdk 21 and targetSdk 34

### Custom Kotlin and AGP Versions

> Create a project with Kotlin 2.1.0 and AGP version 8.7.3

### Full Custom Project

> Create an Android project called MyApp with package com.example.myapp, minSdk 24, targetSdk 35, Compose enabled, in ~/Projects

<Aside type="tip">
  After creating a project, immediately build it to verify everything is set up correctly: "Build my MyApp project"
</Aside>

## Component Scaffolding

### Activities

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="With layout">
    > Create a DetailActivity in my project with package com.example.myapp

    Creates both the Activity Kotlin file and a corresponding XML layout.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Without layout">
    > Scaffold a SettingsActivity without a layout file

    Creates only the Activity Kotlin file — useful for Compose-based activities.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Fragments

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="With layout">
    > Create a ProfileFragment with package com.example.myapp

    Creates the Fragment Kotlin file and XML layout.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Without layout">
    > Create a HomeFragment without a layout

    Fragment only, no XML.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Compose Screens

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Basic screen">
    > Create a ProfileScreen composable with package com.example.myapp

    Generates a screen file with a composable function and preview.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="With ViewModel">
    > Scaffold a SettingsScreen with a ViewModel

    Generates both the screen composable and a ViewModel class.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Scaffold Multiple Components for a Feature

<Steps>
1. Create the screen
   > Create a ProductDetailScreen composable with ViewModel

2. Create a list screen
   > Create a ProductListScreen composable with ViewModel

3. Create a data Activity if needed
   > Create a ProductActivity with package com.example.myapp
</Steps>

## Intent Testing

### Common Intent Actions

| What you want | Prompt |
|---------------|--------|
| Open URL in browser | "Open https://example.com on my device" |
| Open Settings | "Send intent with action android.settings.SETTINGS on my device" |
| Open WiFi settings | "Send intent with action android.settings.WIFI_SETTINGS" |
| Open app settings | "Send intent with action android.settings.APPLICATION_DETAILS_SETTINGS with data package:com.example.myapp" |
| Dial a number | "Send intent with action android.intent.action.DIAL and data tel:+1234567890" |
| Send email | "Send intent with action android.intent.action.SENDTO and data mailto:test@example.com" |
| Open camera | "Send intent with action android.media.action.IMAGE_CAPTURE" |
| Share text | "Send intent with action android.intent.action.SEND with extra android.intent.extra.TEXT=Hello" |

### Custom App Intents

> Send intent with action com.example.myapp.REFRESH on my device

> Send intent VIEW with data https://example.com/product/123 to component com.example.myapp/.DeepLinkActivity

### Intents with Extras

> Send intent with action com.example.MY_ACTION with extras: key1=value1 and key2=value2

### Intents with Flags

> Send intent VIEW with data https://example.com and flag 0x10000000

The flag `0x10000000` is `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK`.

<Aside type="note">
  Intent extras are sent as strings. If your app expects other types, you may need to handle type conversion in your BroadcastReceiver or Activity.
</Aside>

## Deep Link Testing

### Custom Scheme Deep Links

> Test deep link myapp://profile/123 on my device

> Test deep link myapp://settings/notifications

> Test deep link myapp://product?id=456&ref=home

### App Links (HTTPS)

> Test deep link https://example.com/product/456 on my device

> Test https://example.com/user/profile in com.example.myapp

### Restrict to Specific App

> Test deep link myapp://checkout in com.example.myapp

By specifying the package name, you bypass the Android chooser dialog.

### Verify Deep Link Routing

<Steps>
1. Clear logcat first
   > Clear the logcat buffer

2. Test the deep link
   > Test deep link myapp://profile/123 on my device

3. Check logs to verify routing
   > Show logcat for tag DeepLinkHandler

4. Take a screenshot to verify the correct screen
   > Take a screenshot
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  Test both your custom scheme links (`myapp://`) and your App Links (`https://yourdomain.com/`) to make sure both work correctly.
</Aside>

---

## Broadcast Testing

### Send Custom Broadcasts

> Send broadcast com.example.myapp.REFRESH on my device

> Send broadcast com.example.DATA_SYNC

### Broadcasts with Extras

> Send broadcast com.example.CONFIG_UPDATE with extras: version=2 and force=true

### Target Specific Components

> Send broadcast com.example.NOTIFY to component com.example.myapp/.MyReceiver

<Aside type="caution">
  Starting with Android 8.0 (API 26), implicit broadcasts are restricted. Most custom broadcasts need to be explicit (targeting a specific component) or registered dynamically.
</Aside>

## SDK Management

### Check What's Installed

> List my installed SDK packages

Shows all installed platforms, build tools, system images, and other components.

### Find Available Packages

> Show all available SDK packages

Lists everything you can install — platforms, system images, build tools, sources, and extras.

### Install Individual Packages

> Install Android 35 platform

> Install system-images;android-35;google_apis;arm64-v8a

> Install build-tools;35.0.0

### Set Up for a New API Level

<Steps>
1. Install the platform
   > Install platforms;android-35

2. Install a system image for emulators
   > Install system-images;android-35;google_apis;arm64-v8a

3. Install matching build tools
   > Install build-tools;35.0.0

4. Create an emulator with the new API
   > Create an Android 35 emulator called API35_Test
</Steps>

### Install Multiple Packages at Once

> Install platforms;android-34, system-images;android-34;google_apis;arm64-v8a, and build-tools;34.0.0

<Aside type="tip">
  When setting up a new development environment, install the platform + system image + build tools together to save time.
