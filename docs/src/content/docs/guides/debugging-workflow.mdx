## Logcat Filtering

Logcat is your primary debugging tool. Android Pilot gives you powerful filtering options.

### By Priority Level

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Errors only">
    > Show me the last 100 error logs from my device
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Warnings+">
    > Show warning and above logs
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="All logs">
    > Show the last 200 logcat lines
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### By Tag

> Show logcat for tag "MyApp" with at least Info priority

### By Search String

> Search logcat for "NullPointerException"

> Search logcat for "OutOfMemoryError" in the last 500 lines

### By Time

> Show logs since 2025-01-15 10:30:00

### Combined Filters

> Show error logs for tag "CrashHandler" containing "fatal" from the last 200 lines

<Aside type="tip">
  Clear logcat before reproducing a bug to reduce noise: "Clear the logcat buffer"
</Aside>

## Visual Debugging

### Screenshots

> Take a screenshot of my device

> Capture a screenshot and save it to ~/Desktop/bug-screenshot.png

### Screen Recording

> Record my device screen for 30 seconds

Record while reproducing a bug, then review the video.

### UI Hierarchy

> Dump the UI hierarchy of the current screen

This returns XML showing every view, its bounds, text, and accessibility info. Useful for finding views that aren't visible or debugging layout issues.

## Shell Commands for Debugging

> Run "dumpsys meminfo com.example.myapp" on the device

> Run "dumpsys activity top" to see the current activity

> Run "dumpsys cpuinfo" to check CPU usage
